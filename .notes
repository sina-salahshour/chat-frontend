"Definition for rule 'jsdoc/newline-after-description' was not found" // the rule is removed from the eslint plugin so i removed it from eslintrc

//added plugin "eslint-plugin-tailwindcss" for tailwind based linting

//added rule  `"@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports": "error"`, for consistent type imports
