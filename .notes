## "Definition for rule 'jsdoc/newline-after-description' was not found"
-  the rule is removed from the eslint plugin so i removed it from eslintrc

## added plugin "eslint-plugin-tailwindcss" for tailwind based linting

## added rule  `"@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports": "error"`, for consistent type imports

## currently store does not have any reducer so console shows an error about it

##  currently nextjs app route has a bug that causes framer motion <AnimatePresence/> to stop working in the layour level, so i used a hack to play the exit animation myself and thend change the route
